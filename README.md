A decompiler for Roblox's Lua based programming language (Luau https://luau-lang.org/). The Unluau project consists of two different .NET namespaces: ``Unluau`` (the main decompiler) and ``Unluau.CLI`` the command line interface for the decompiler. As of right now, Unluau is the most powerful Luau decompiler availible to the public, supporting most of Luau's opcodes and language features. With Unluau you can take a compiled Luau script and restore it to an accurate representation of what the original script may have been.

Unluau `2.0.0-beta` is under heavy development and doesn't have friendly user interface for usage. It is receiving updates frequently and should be in a releasable stage in the upcoming weeks.
